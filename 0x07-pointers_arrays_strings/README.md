This read me file contains the task of project 0x07-pointers, arrays and strings

File: 0-memset - function that fills memory with a constant byte.
The _memset() function fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b
Returns a pointer to the memory area s

File: 1-memcpy - function that copies memory area. 
The _memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest
Returns a pointer to dest

File: 2-strchr - function that locates a character in a string.
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string s, or NULL if the character is not found

File: 3-strspn - function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
Returns the number of bytes in the initial segment of s which consist only of bytes from accept

File: 4-strpbrk - function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
The _strpbrk() function locates the first occurrence in the string s of any of the bytes in the string accept
Returns a pointer to the byte in s that matches one of the bytes in accept, or NULL if no such byte is found

File: 5-strstr - function that locates a substring.
The _strstr() function finds the first occurrence of the substring needle in the string haystack. The terminating null bytes (\0) are not compared
Returns a pointer to the beginning of the located substring, or NULL if the substring is not found.

File: 7-print_chessboard - function that prints the chessboard.

File: 8-print_diagsums - function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.

File: 100-set_string - function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.

File: 101-crackme_password - file that contains the password for the crackme2 executable.
