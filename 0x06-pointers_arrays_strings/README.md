File: 0-strcat - is a function that concatenates two strings. This function
appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null
byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte.
Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest

File: 1-strncat - is a function that concatenates two strings.
The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that
-it will use at most n bytes from src; and
-src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
Return a pointer to the resulting string dest

File: 2-strncpy - is a function that copies a string.

File: 4-rev_array - is a function that reverses the content of an array of
integers. Where n is the number of elements of the array

Letters a and A should be replaced by 4
Letters e and E should be replaced by 3
Letters o and O should be replaced by 0
Letters t and T should be replaced by 7
Letters l and L should be replaced by 1

File: 100-rot13 - is  a function that encodes a string using rot13.

File: 101-print_number - is a function that prints an integer.

File: 102-magic - is a program that prints a[2] = 98, followed by a new line.

File: 103-infinite_add - is function that adds two numbers.

File: 104-print_buffer - is a function that prints a buffer.
